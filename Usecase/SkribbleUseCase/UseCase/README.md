# Skribble most basic UseCase
What are we doing here?
- we want to do the most simplest use case with the Skribble API
- in this case it is to upload a PDF-File
- send a signature request (it sends an e-mail to the signers with the PDF that should be signed)
- the signers sign the document
- when the document is signed from all signers then it downloads the PDF to your local machine
